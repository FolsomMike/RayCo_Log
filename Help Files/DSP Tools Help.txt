The display is based around the sample rate. The "Time Base" 
provides a means to specify the number of zeroes to insert
between samples for the purpose of up-sampling. It also
stretches the screen, but doing so will cause the output to
be zero-stuffed.

--- Zero Stuffing ---

The purpose of "Up Sampling" is to specify the number of
zeroed data points to be inserted into the output waveform
(zero-stuffing for up-sampling) between samples.

If "Up Sampling" is set to 1 pixel/sample, then no zero-
stuffing will occur. All filter settings for calculating
FIR coefficients should then be based on the "Sampling
Frequency".

If "Up Samping" is set to a higher number, such as 4
pixels/sample, then 3 zero stuffed data points will be inserted
between each sample in the output waveform. The filter
coefficients should be calculated based on the (Sampling
Frequency * 4), as the inserted zeroes effectively
change the sampling rate.

WARNING: If the "Up Sampling" value is used to stretch the
screen without entering adjusted FIR coefficients, the filter
response frequencies will be shifted.

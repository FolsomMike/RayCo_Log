;16 channels for 8 shoes - 8 channels positive, 8 channels negative

number of channels=16

;3D map info

;this should match the width of the associated map if the
;data is to be mapped; set to 0 if no map used

;For Transverse, each shoe is considered to be a clock position

number of clock positions=48

;Translate each input clock position to a clock position on the map.
;The "number of lines" entry tells how many lines follow which contain
;the translation info. This allows the data to be broken into multiple lines
;for clarity.
;The "number of grid clocks" entry specifies how many clocks on the map
;are represented by on source clock...this allows an input clock position
;to be expanded to cover a specified number of grids on the map in the
;height or length direction of the map.

;Transverse Notes
;
;The transverse system has two rings of shoes, Ring 1 and Ring2.
;In the map data from the board, each shoe is placed in a clock
;position corresponding to the shoe number, even though this does not
;place the shoe in a true physical clock location. The translation in the
;inspection software corrects for this. Thus, in the input map:
;    shoe0:clk0, shoe1:clk1...shoe7:clck7.
;
;From a clock position standpoint, every other shoe is in Ring1 with
;the interleaving shoes in Ring 2. Thus the clock positions are
;interleaved between the two rings, so each source clock for a ring skips
;in gaps on the map with the other ring filling in the gaps.
;
;There may be 8 or 16 shoes depending on the size of the inspection head.

;16 channels for 8 shoes - 8 channels positive, 8 channels negative

number of channels=16

;3D map info

;this should match the width of the associated map if the
;data is to be mapped; set to 0 if no map used

;For Transverse, each shoe is considered to be a clock position

number of clock positions=48

;Translate each input clock position to a clock position on the map.
;The "number of lines" entry tells how many lines follow which contain
;the translation info. This allows the data to be broken into multiple lines
;for clarity.
;The "number of grid clocks" entry specifies how many clocks on the map
;are represented by on source clock...this allows an input clock position
;to be expanded to cover a specified number of grids on the map in the
;height or length direction of the map.

;Transverse Notes
;
;The transverse system has two rings of shoes, Ring 1 and Ring2.
;In the map data from the board, each shoe is placed in a clock
;position corresponding to the shoe number, even though this does not
;place the shoe in a true physical clock location. The translation in the
;inspection software corrects for this. Thus, in the input map:
;    shoe0:clk0, shoe1:clk1...shoe7:clck7.
;
;From a clock position standpoint, every other shoe is in Ring1 with
;the interleaving shoes in Ring 2. Thus the clock positions are
;interleaved between the two rings, so each source clock for a ring skips
;in gaps on the map with the other ring filling in the gaps.
;
;There may be 8 or 16 shoes depending on the size of the inspection head.
;Each shoe is set up to cover two grids in the height direction on the map
;(which is the circumferential direction on the pipe). Thus, 16 shoes
;cover 32 grids. For a typical map with 24 grids (height), the 16 shoes
;are allocated over the 24 grids with some overlapping as necessary.
